#"Campus Connections" Application

##Brief:

This project is aimed at connecting faculty and students across school
campuses, and allow them to join classes, create groups, host study
sessions, and public events. The goal of this application is to provide
students with specific, simple and easy to use controls to help with
creating and finding study sessions, meeting with like-minded individuals,
and staying apprised of events within the school.
