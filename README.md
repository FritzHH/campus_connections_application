#"Campus Connections" Application

##Brief:

This project is aimed at connecting faculty and students across school
campuses, and allow them to join classes, create groups, host study

students with specific, simple and easy to use controls to help with
meeting with like-minded individuals and staying apprised of events
within the school.
